# Sales Forecasting using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project predicts product sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.  
We use linear regression to forecast sales performance.

## Dataset
- Source: Advertising dataset (Kaggle)
- Features: `TV`, `Radio`, `Newspaper`
- Target: `Sales`

## Steps
1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Visualize relationships with scatter plots
3. Train linear regression model
4. Evaluate with MSE and R²

## Results
- R² Score: ~0.85–0.95
- MSE: Low (good prediction)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
